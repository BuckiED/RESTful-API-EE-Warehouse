## EE Warehouse (Verteilte Systeme)

The desired target of this is a little Warehouse on a local Website using Apache Tomcat and the RESTful web service.

The boundary conditions are:

* Eclipse JEE as development IDE
* RESTful web service with Jersey as API
* use of Apache Tomcat as local server

My target is to build a "little" local website containing 2-4 electronic parts with a pricing tag, an "avaible parts"- tag and an "add to shopping cart"- button. A nice feature would be to have little images of the parts next to their names.

Hitherto I only achieved a simple "hello Jersey" example which I want to turn into the mentioned warehouse.
